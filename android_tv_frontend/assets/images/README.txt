Place hero and poster images here if using local assets.

Examples:
- assets/images/hero_bvs.jpg
- assets/images/posters/arrival.jpg

Update assets/data/home.json to point to these paths, e.g.:
"heroPoster": "assets/images/hero_bvs.jpg",
"recommendations": [{ "id": "arrival", "title": "Arrival", "poster": "assets/images/posters/arrival.jpg" }]

This file ensures the directory exists for Flutter asset resolution.
